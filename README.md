This repository contains a collection of MATLAB and Simulink events hosted during my tenure as a MATLAB Ambassador at Politecnico di Milano. These events are designed for students and anyone interested in exploring the various topics presented.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders, with each folder dedicated to a specific event. Within each folder, you'll find all the materials and resources related to that event.

## How to Get Started

Click the **"Open in MATLAB Online"** button at the top of this page to launch the repository directly in your MATLAB Online environment. This makes it easy to interact with the content and explore the events hands-on.
